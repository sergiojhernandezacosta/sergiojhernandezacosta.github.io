     Learning this language, in my opinion, was quite an undertaking. 
     Going from the syntax and logic in Python to what C++ 
     has to offer was different, to say the least.
    </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px; text-align: justify">
      I have had valuable learning experiences in my interactions with C++. 
      The first was in the water gauge school project I undertook my first semester of university 
      (to be fair, the project entailed Arduino, and Arduino is a close relative to C++). 
      I programmed in C++ again during my internship with the USDA. 
      In a similar fashion to the school project, I worked with an Arduino microcontroller. 
      In fact, the functions that I needed to execute for the school project and the internship project 
      were identical. All I needed was for the microcontroller to be able to communicate with another 
      electronic component such as a cellphone or computer.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px; text-align: justify">
      For the <a href="WaterGauge.html" target="_blank">water gauge project</a>, we set up a water-filled 
      container that had a faucet. The intent was to drain the water out. 
      Think water cooler or sink faucet, even. 
      We also installed leak sensors that worked like buoys. 
      When the sensors moved to indicate a change in water level, 
      we wanted a microcontroller to have the ability to text us a message 
      when the container was at 50% and 25% capacity, respectively.
      Likewise, for the <a href="USDA.html" target="_blank" >USDA internship</a>, 
      I was responsible for a cylindrical vessel that contained sand inside. 
      My supervisor's experiment involved the container: he wanted to pour water through the sand 
      and observe the trickle. There were sensors placed throughout the surface of the container, 
      and my responsibility was to create a means of communication coming from the container. 
      Using, again, an Arduino board, I had to locate the water as it slowly trickled down the sand and quantify the speed and flux of the water. 
      All of that information was programmed to be sent remotely to my supervisor's computer. 
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px; text-align: justify">
      One of the departmental classes, ME 4334 Control of Dynamic Systems relied heavily on MATLAB
      and C++ to analyze and design electromechanical systems.
      The course was stellar in teaching me about characteristics such as steady-state error and transient response.
      Also, for example, I got to write a simple C++ program to compute the transient response of an RC circuit with respect to time.
